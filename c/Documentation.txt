Documentation of dht project, iteration 1 version 0.1.20130407-1136 Team 19/20

Instructions:
Make sure that you have openssl-devel package installed, as it is required for
the compilation, after you have it, you can compile the node by running:
"make all"
Run the node with following command
"dhtnode own_hostname own_port"
To connect to server and other nodes enter command
"connect server_url port"
To exit and safely disconnect enter command
"exit"
To exit without asking for permision from server use:
"exit force"

Iplementation:
DHT-node is implemented in file dhtnode.c and prototyped at respective header file
DHT-packet structure and many macro values are defined in dhtpacket.h
Input is handled by consoleui.c and .h and neworker.c and .h are used for sending
and reciving data. We implemented the project using Netbeans as IDE and gcc on
cygwin as a compiler, cygwin provides us with posix-implementation. We also used 
openssl for sha1-hashes. Code is commented in-line and with javadoc comments in 
header files per function.

Testing:
Testing was done by running server at one of our own ubuntu servers, and running
nodes from our own windows computers. Testing was done by connecting and closing
nodes in different order and printing debug information. All the bugs that were
found during the testing were fixed. 

Time managment:
Time managment was done with google drive spreedsheet. Amounth of work was as
expected, but divided quit unevenly between members of team. here is our 
timesheet: http://tinyurl.com/timespendc

Practise improvements for second iteration:
-Starting early, first iteration code was developed in a 3 day spurt and that
made things pretty hectic
-Better planning for architechture in order to better distribute workload and to 
make sure that no code is wasted. This also helps us to progress more steadily.
